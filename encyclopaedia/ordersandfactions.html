A military group like no other, the Athenian Guard is a unit of soldiers sworn to the monarch, the city and each other. These men are tasked with the protection of the city they live and serve in whether that be manning the city walls in case of an attack or simply clearing the streets of drunkards after a rowdy night. They are the ones who keep the peace and ensure that all are secure under their protective vigil, day and night. The Athenian Guards are the chief policing force in the kingdom and in addition to running the city’s fylaki, it is not uncommon to see men from its ranks patrolling the streets with their signature blue sashes to mark them as a member of this order.
<br><br>Although the protection of the capital city is their chief priority, the Athenian Guard is especially noteworthy for their dedication to the crown and whoever wears it. They will protect the monarch at any cost but they will not involve themselves in the petty disputes between the Dynasteías as to who should be wearing it. After all, they are above the messy business of politics and are under the firm belief that it will bring nothing but chaos into their ranks. That being said, noblemen are not required to forgo any titles in order to join the Guard’s ranks. They are simply expected to remain silent on any family loyalties whilst on active duty. If they cannot do so, they will be sent home in disgrace.
<br><br>Valuing a man’s talents over any other quality, the Athenian Guard only allows those of an adequate skill level into their active ranks. However, they allow any citizen of the city, noble-born or common, into its barracks and are one of the few units in Hellas willing to spend years training new recruits until they reach said level of expertise. This high standard and dedication to filling their ranks with skilled fighters is what distinguishes them from other, similar orders and encourages a level of camaraderie between the men and respect between the citizens and the Guard. In exchange, though, all those within the unit are expected to dedicate their lives to their service and retiring from the guard is rare before the grip of old age.

<u>History</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
The origins of the Athenian Guard can be found several hundred years ago, back before Athenia was the shining gem that it is today. Back then, the young city had grown faster than it could support and mass numbers with limited resources produced desperate and criminal acts. For years, noblemen blamed the incivility of the lower classes for the violence on the streets. Those of common birth blamed a nobility failing to care for its people. Tensions came to a head when Nicon of Anagnostou, the eldest son of a baron, was found dead in the street.
<br><br>It was clear that his passing had not been peaceful by any means. Shards of terracotta were scattered on the ground around him and left in gaping wounds. To this day, his death is an unsolved mystery. However, the true horror came after his death and before he was found. The dogs and rats had scavenged the body whilst lowlifes of the city had stripped the corpse of anything of value, including the royal blue himation that the man had been adorned with. Dirt upon the body was evidence of several of the thieves literally stepping upon the dead in their desperate, heartless need for his possessions. The sheer inhumanity of the death affected men and women at all levels of society. Whoever did this had to be brought to justice.
<br><br>The king himself offered a handsome reward for whoever found the responsible party. With the promise of gold shining in the eyes of desperate men, many flocked to the palace gates with raised voices proclaiming that they knew who had done the terrible deed, but none could provide proof so the prize went unclaimed. The common people began to feel frustrated; such attention to a nobleman's death when similar fates befell their loved ones any other day of the week was distasteful. Members of the Anagnostou family were met with protests and angry mobs demanding similar reparation for their own dead. When the last of Anagnostou's male heirs were killed in a chariot accident, spurred by a frustrated crowd, something had to be done.
<br><br>Nobles gathered with demands to their king for a military unit; one that would ensure their safety on the streets. Though hesitant to introduce more weaponry to the skirmishes in the city, the king accepted that matters could not continue as they were. He appointed the House of Antonis with the task of setting up a fresh military unit for the capital itself. Within a week, the military experts of Antonis had taken Lieutenants and promising young fighters from their own province militias and brought together nearly fifty men to serve in the capital's first policing force.
<br><br>As the sun set over the city, this new brigade was dispersed into the streets in small groups of heavily armoured men all under the orders to put a stop to any deviance they came across. There was only one rule: they were not to kill anyone, regardless of the crime committed. Drunkards were escorted to their homes, brawlers were incapacitated on the spot and any thief to be found was immediately hauled to makeshift jails throughout the city to await punishment for their crime. Initially the action was a failure; the soldiers quickly became targets for the frustration of the people. But the Antonis were harsh on their men and unyielding in their rules. Eventually, the soldiers who would not kill or maim but contained and supported those from all backgrounds began to turn public opinion. Within a month, the nobles had criticisms of the Guard for not operating in favour of the upper classes. But the common people saw the Guard as heroes.
<br><br>At the king's words, the nobles were silenced and the Guard continued in their practice of equal treatment. Commoner and noblefolk alike grew used to the relief of city streets now safe to walk at night. Of course, such progression did not eradicate crime entirely. And the Guard was soon outfitted with equipment and a recognisable uniform: a sash and cloak combination, in the same bright blue shreds of Nicon of Anagnostou's himation. The Anagnostou family might have fallen out of existence but their legacy would continue. The king eventually agreed to a special fund to support the Guard and one of the old estate houses, now fallen out of use, was converted to a city barracks for the men. This facility included places for rest and training, but also armament stores and a city prison for holding drunkards and arrested criminals.
<br><br>Currently, the Athenia Guard work on rotation, protecting the city walls, the docklands and the Inner Circle, as well as organising patrols throughout the city day and night. They also supply the Royal Palace's guards which are maintained under a specialist Captain who reports to the Commander of the Guard. These men have their own rotations and shifts that are appropriately matched to the royals they are protecting.
<u>Roles and Titles</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<span>Commander</span>Leader of the Guard and the ultimate authority. He is personally in charge of organising the security of the king and his family. Most often from a royal or noble family, but not always. They will always be an experienced militant: not an appointed politician or official. Usually they will have served in the Guard itself before being promoted to Commander.
<span>Deputy</span>Serves only for a year at a time, the Deputy Commander of the Guard is chosen at the annual Feast of Men and Kings. They serve until the next feast. It is not seen as a demotion when their term comes to an end. But there is prestige attached to being appointed Deputy, particularly if te rank is awarded for multiple years in a row.
<span>Captain</span>A captain leads a large group of soldiers and lieutenants permanently. They are responsible for these men, their tasks and their resources. Captains answer to the Deputy Commander.
<span>Lieutenant</span>Appointed to a soldier who shoes particular promise, courage and skill, the rank of lieutenant does not have a formal band of men to command but they do hold authority. If they issue an order to a soldier, it is to be followed. They will often be given men to command for particular tasks or missions. Lieutenants answer to their Captain.
<u>Practices and Rituals</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Initiation</b>Joining the Guard</span>
All men are welcomed to join the ranks of the Athenian Guard, regardless of their social rank but they must be prepared to fully commit their lives to the order. New initiates move into the city’s barracks and live the life of a common soldier, completing the laborious menial tasks required by the unit. Some born to high classes can escape this if they're already an officer in a provincial military but even then their skills are put to the test in a monthly arena-style test. All initiatives, regardless of whether they have been so for a single day or ten years, are pitted against one of two highly-skilled soldiers (one noble, one common) selected by the Commander. If they are victorious in two-on-one combat, the recruit is welcomed into the Guard.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>The Feast of Men and Kings</b>An Annual Feast</span>
In honour of the agreement made between Guard and Crown to provide mutual support for one another, an annual feast is held within the palace walls for the members of the nobility and a lucky fifty full members of the Guard (selected by random ballot). Hosted in early spring, the courtyard is transformed into three dining areas; the Guard, the nobility and one raised table reserved for the monarch and the Commander of the Guard. Paid for by the nobility, this feast serves as a way to honour the soldiers’ dedication to keeping the peace in a way unexperienced by other military units. It is a fantastic experience to be one of the fifty men selected to join the Commander during the feast and some Guards become quite competitive for the chance to be chosen and mingle with the upper-classes; trading ballot tickets and bribing friends for theirs. Whilst the soldiers of the Guard may have seen certain areas of the palace whilst guarding it, a formal meal and being treated as one of the people they normally shadow is an entirely different opportunity and a highly sought reward.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Elections</b>Assigning the Deputy-Commander</span>
It is also at the Feast of Men and Kings that the Commander of the Guard will name his deputy to serve by his side for the upcoming year. If the Commander should retire or be otherwise unfit for duty, the Deputy immediately becomes the new leader. However, simply being named Deputy is not enough to ensure that one will ascend to that position. All active and retired Captains of the order must anonymously vote on the Commander's choice for a Deputy by drawing either a Circle or a Square, representing yes and no respectively, on a small piece of parchment which is placed upon the high table with the king and Commander. As these men are casting their votes, any member of the Guard is allowed to rise from their seat and speak on behalf of the nominee. Although it is frowned upon to speak against the man being voted on, no one is prevented from doing so. After all the votes have been cast and the decision is read, if the nominated Deputy has the majority vote, he is welcomed up to the raised table to sit beside the Commander for the remainder of the evening. A Deputy is nominated every year regardless of whether the position is currently filled. More often than not, the Deputy from the previous year is nominated and able to continue serving. Serving for even a year is considered a prestigious honour, so not continuing in the role of Deputy after a year is not a loss or considered a failure: merely the way the system works.
</div>
<u>Joining the Order</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
Any trainees or initiatives that are interested in joining the Guard are required to move into the Guard's barracks, don a simplified version of the Guard's uniform and armour (but with a white sash instead of a blue one) and must perform the menial and maintenance tasks of the barracks. Every month, an Initiation Test day is held and all trainees currently living within the barracks have the choice of taking the exam. On this day, they are required to beat in one-on-one combat an existing member of the Guard. An unsuccessful participant is not rejected from the barracks but, instead, allowed to remain inside the Guard's home, continuing their menial tasks until the next testing day. They can continue to do this as many times as they like or need. There is a certain level of pride and fame in passing the Guard's Initiation Day on the first attempt. However, there is also a level of respect for a man determined to keep trying. A trainee who has failed many times might be met with ridicule and begrudging respect in equal measure. Once the initiate has passed their Testing Day, they offer their oath of loyalty to the Guard and become a fully-fledged member of the Guard, are factored into duty rotation and are permitted to live outside of the barracks. They must, however, live within the city.
<span>In Roleplay</span>If you want your character to be a member of the Guard you can create them as a member already (no permission required) or they can become a member in-game. Passing a Testing Day can be written as a normal thread of your choice. However, if there are multiple members of the Guard in play, it is worth contacting staff in case the Testing Day would work well for a site-wide event.

The Babylon Enforcers are an order with active presence in the lives of those they protect. For the common people, they patrol the streets and keep crime to a minimum. For the nobility, they are a familiar sight guarding the hallways of the imperial palace. A dedicated group of soldiers selected from the babylonian military academies to patrol and police the city, these fighters have particular skills in defence and siege protocols. Well known for being the protective wall of bodies against foreign attack, the enforcers are beloved by the people of Babylon and are treated with great respect for the additional training and expertise they must accomplish before donning the enforcer uniform. As they are trained to fight together for the sake of many, the order possesses a strong sense of brotherhood and unity.
<br><br>For soldiers considering a career with the enforcers, the duties of thise order have their benefits and drawbacks. For those who relish head-to-head combat with their enemies, who seek to travel and who disdain the polite interactions with noblility, volunteering for training with the enforcers would be foolish. But for others - the men who seek closeness with their family, who long to protect their home and enjoy the career potential of greater learning and rubbing shoulders with those of influence... the enforcers is a career path of great advantage.
<br><br>One particular sect of militant who would enjoy the challenge of applying to the enforcers would be those of invention and strategy. Defending a large city with your civilian wards on your doorstep and the enemy a hundred yards away is a very particular style of fighting and requires additional preparation, tutorage and learning. Those who graduate from babylonia's military academies will then serve additional training periods with the enforcers themselves before they are considered fully-fledged members. Once certified, these soldiers are split into Watchmen and Watermen: those who defend the walls of the city with expertise in battlement defence and those who know the waterways of the city and can use the canals and rivers to their greatest military advantage. In either sector, these men and women are experts in their field and their roles attract many who enjoy using their brain alongside their brawn.

<u>History</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
In the early days, the Babylonian military stayed separate from the palace fighting battles against enemy nations on far away borders. Then, during the reign of Lugal Cherib an'Ashina, the borders of Babylonia's great empire drew in closer. War came to the capital city's front gates and the world changed. From then on, Babylonia has existed as a smaller city state and trained its fighters to defend the battlements of their capital as one would the sacred plains of the borderlands.
<br><br>The original enforcers were a rag-tag unit of rebellious thinkers and maverick fighters. They were inventive on the walls and would orchestrate ambushes and attacks on the Lake Milh and canals north of the city. Their experiences were eventually written down and formalised into training protocols for the docks and riverbanks of the city. And as the walls and battlements around the capital grew, so too did the handbook of those trained to defend them.
<br><br>Within twenty years Babylon became an impenetrable fortress. But even the thickest walls can allow the slippery entry of rats. Spies and espionage became the only means of breaching the city, making the noble manors and palaces a target for enemy plundering. The Enforcers were eventually summoned to the imperial palace of Lugal Ninospali, son of the late Cherib and a great admirer of the newly formed order. His instructions would later become fact, then evolve into tradition: the Enforcers would be the authority not only one defending the city walls but the corridors and halls of the imperial palace and all government buildings within the city.
<br><br>For over a hundred years the Babylon Enforcers have kept the streets of the capital safe. They arrest criminals and trouble makers, treasonous spies and enemy collaborators alike. They are so familiar with Babylonian architecture, canals and acqueducts that they blend into the stone, seeming to move around the streets like ghosts. Training was required to ensure these soldiers knew how to move through civilian populations and districts with speed and keep innocent bystanders away from conflict. Eventually, a new institution and regime was formed for specialised training. No soldier could become a qualified Enforcer without completing this additional labour of learning.
<u>Roles and Titles</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<span>City Captain</span>Leader of the Enforcers and the ultimate authority on security and defence of the city and the imperial palace, not to mention any government buildings or sacred spaces within the capital. He is the ultimate authority on training, equipment, resources and duties carried out by the order. He is, however, the social and political inferior to the royal houses and must bow to their commands whether he agrees with them or not, making negotiation and charm a required asset to his role. Unlike other Babylonian Captains who have elevated to a rank beyond actual fighting, the City Captain is usually involved in any conflict himself. He also does not possess a Deputy. Instead, he has a series of aides or attendants to carry out his missives and orders to the Ensigns within his order.
<span>Ensign</span>Ensigns are a normal rank within the Babylonian military. They command a small group of men, ensure their resources are adequate and their duties assigned. They report to their immediate Captain. These duties are exactly the same under the City Captain, but will be focused on the capital with less travel or combat beyond the walls. An Ensign and the soldiers under his command will belong to either the Watchmen or Watermen groups within the Enforcers.
<span>Deputy Ensign</span>Every Ensign within the Enforcers (there are usually about a dozen) will have his own Deputy to support him in his duties and take over his role should he fall in battle.
<span>Watchmen</span>Once a soldier has completed his specialised training with the Enforcers he will be either a Watchmen or a Waterman. Watchemen are experts in the use of battlements, how to defend gates and fortifications and how to ensure the city remains unbreached. Both Watchmen and Watermen hold the rank of Erim in the Babylonian military (a basic soldier).
<span>Watermen</span>Watermen, on the other hand, are experts in fighting on the canals, using the rivers to their advantage, keeping the populace safe by escaping through sewer tunnels and acqueducts and using the rivers north and south in combat. Both Watchmen and Watermen hold the rank of Erim in the Babylonian military (a basic soldier).
<u>Practices and Rituals</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Initiation</b>Joining the Enforcerers</span>
All soldiers entering the Enforcers must first complete the usual training within the Babylonian military academies. Prior to this graduation ceremony they can apply or be head-hunted for the Enforcer order. Those who are selected join the order after they graduate the academy instead of being assigned to a normal military unit. The first night of initiation with the Enforcers is more a celebration of their graduation from the academy. It is tradition to consume copious amounts of alcohol and play childish games, as the evening signifies the end of the adolescent stage in a soldiers career and the beginning of adult responsibilities. Simple athletic challenges, arm-wrestling, play-fighting and silly pranks are also common. The soldiers are given a day to recover from their inevitable lack of sleep and hangovers before their training with the Enforcers then begins...
<br><br>When asked, many Enforcers recall the Initiation as the start of the brotherhood among them, though it is tradition to keep the activities and whatever else occurs on the night of initiation secret from all except those who have experienced it.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Enforcer Training</b>After the Academy</span>
As their duties are unlike those of other Erim (soldiers), Enforcers must go through an additional two years of training post military academy. This training includes wall defence, the use of canals, memorising the water and sewerage systems of the city and the architecture of districts and key buildings, the protocol for liaising with royalty when assigned to the imperial palace, the use of riverboats in combat and the inventions used from up high on the battlements. Only when an Erim is a master of the city and its ways and means can they graduate as an Enforcer and choose their preferred sector: Watchmen or Watermen.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Graduation Challenge</b>Choose Your Path</span>
Once trained, an Enforcer will face a graduation challenge. This is usually a set obstacle course or scavanger challenge held across the city. The route and challenge is different every year and known for being near impossible. It is less about whether an Erim achieves the challenge than how they go about tackling it as many of its challenges focus on unpredictability and how a soldier with innovate and think on their feet; how they apply their training with wisdom. This event is held annually and is a grand celebration in the city with residents and common peerage helping or hindering the contestants. Upon the completion of the event, the City Captain decides who has performed well enough to graduate. Those that have not must try again the next year. Those that do, become either a Watchman or a Waterman. It is their choice which specialty they will serve under. They are then assigned to a particular Ensign and go into active duty. At the end of the graduation challenge, all newly confirmed Watchman and Waterman will be marked with a henna tattoo on the back of their neck. It is the Babylonian symbol for "brotherhood". This mark lasts approximately three months. When it fades, the soldier's probation period is over and they are given a silver pendant / token with the same mark as the tattoo. They are expected to wear this whilst on duty but most wear it permanently. Some even seek to have the mark of their order tattooed permanently into their skin or renew the henna mark repeatedly elsewhere on their body (as to add it again to the nape of their neck would mark them as a newcomer instead of a respected veteran).
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Brotherhood Festival</b>Annual Event</span>
Whilst the daytime is dedicated to the Graduation Challenge for all knew members of the order, the evening and night become a festival of celebration. Soldiers that have been lost in conflict over the last year are mourned and their spirits celebrated. Those who have been promoted are saluted and drank to. Those who have graduated are rewarded and those who failed commisserate with their brothers. It is the ultimate punishment for foolishness or misbehaviour to be assigned guard duty during the Brotherhood Festival.
</div>
<u>Joining the Order</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
The Babylon Enforcers are selected from the soldiers who graduate from a Babylonian military academy. All academies complete their training at the same time every year and assign their qualified Erim to military units. Soldiers that are chosen by the Enforcers or who apply to the order themselves are carefully selected. No one may join the Enforcers without first completing the academy's training. As Enforcer training is so specific, Erim rarely transfer back from the Enforcers to the normal military after their training and probationary period but may do so during them.
<span>In Roleplay</span>If you want your character to be a member of the Babylon Enforcers, they must first have a history in the military and be a graduate of the academy. They must then attend an initiation event and complete the two years of training required with the Enforcers. Any character can be made having already completed this process. But if you wish your character to complete the process in game, you will need to wait for a site event for both Initiation and Graduation from Enforcer training. You can <a href="/conversation/new/1">request</a> an event like this from the staff team at any time.

As the paid weapons of Jarls and Konungrs across the land, the men and women who call themselves Brothers understand one another's simmering lust for battle and their abhorrence for political fawning or niceties. All men are equal when pocketing coin. And all equals eventually die.
<br><br>Not only trained to the highest standards of military combat, these warriors also possess the secrets to an elixir that escalates their bloodlust, removes all fear and sends them into battle as wild animals. Without a sense of self-preservation or hesitancy, the berserkers are the most fearsome fighting force in the Ostjörð lands, whether they travel in packs or as individuals.
<br><br>As far as others are concerned, the berserker order sits upon a wheel, turning from acclaim to fear and back again. Their repute and reception is based on their assessor: are they fearsome warriors due awe and respect or crazed fighters driven mad by bloodlust? A rabid dog is gloriously violent in battle but will it also bite the hand that feeds? It is the duty of berserker chieftains and their leader, the Maw of Fenrir, to play a little of the social game when their hounds grow too unruly for good business. It is the warriors' duty to see patrons victorious in all things bloody.

<u>History</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
The order was founded countless generations ago, and nobody outside of the brotherhood agrees on when or how. But tales of the Ghoði tell the Saga thusly: Long ago, there were two brothers, Thorkell the Axe and Hamar the Grim-Eyed. Thorkell was a canny warrior, a breaker of shields and spirits, whilst his brother Hamar was one of the most cunning potion-makers to have ever walked the land.
<br><br>Battle after battle they fought in, serving lords and masters alike. Thorkell’s strength was magnified by the brews that Hamar made him and he would break many a foeman in rains of blood. When combat had passed, however, Thorkell would need to restrain the beast within; a beast that demanded more violence upon one and all. Witnessing madness in his eyes, Thorkell was shunned by many a Jarl, making the brothers nomads of strength and gore.
<br><br>Whispers of blasphemy followed them. For neither Thorkell nor Hamar carried Odin’s spear or Thor’s hammer about their neck. Whilst their peers spoke of Ragnarok as an inevitable tragedy of the turning wheel; a moment in which the Gods would fall and the world would be plunged into darkness, Thorkell and Hamar awaited Ragnarok with eagerness. Believing it the simple fate of nature and a necessity for renewal and growth, the brothers saw Fenrir, the great wolf that would begin the ending of all, as a savior of life; the reaper who would strip the world clean and plant new seeds. Thorkell and Hamar never denied the power and privilege of the Aegis deities; they simply saw the tales of the worlds-ending in a different light. A curious, blasphemous, oddly-optimistic light. Some called it treachery to the gods. Others an open acceptance of destiny: that all men must die.
<br><br>Those who shared in this philosophy began to join the brothers. Those prepared to walk the bloody road of the wild pair were taught the ways of battle by Thorkell and how to channel the power of Hamar's sacred draught. The small band of fighters quickly became a force for destruction that no man could match. Those who did not excel in the physical prowess of the warriors, were taught the creation of the previous elixir by Hamar.
<br><br>With greater numbers came greater needs. And needs required money. Thorkell and Hamar were soon leaders of a service, lent to konungrs and jarls at precious cost. Additional plunder from their victories further lined the pockets of the fledgling order.
<br><br>The warband swelled and grew more powerful, those that joined the brothers bore the finest weapons, the strongest shields, the standards of great champions who had fallen beneath their unyielding boots. A home was needed for such resources and for the rested head of men. 'The Berserkers', as they were now named in fearful whispers, journeyed to the lands of the Ironwind and the fresh air of the coast, where the waters teemed with fish. They used their vast wealth to build the fortress of Tiwsborg on a high, defensible crag, and thus the brotherhood was given a home.
<br><br>Tiwsborg, to this day, is the order's hearth. From here, chieftains take their small warbands of fighters across the lands to seek work, returning to deposit their plundered treasure. Whilst most warbands have their own homes or estates, ruled by their leaders, it is to Tiwsborg that they must eventually return each year, if only to pay the percentage of their gains to the order's treasury and restock on the covetously stored elixir. Tiwsborg, therefore, has an ever changing amount of people in residence, with unassigned rooms and open dining tables that welcome any of their number. It is also here that the Maw of Fenrir lives permanently, acting as the first among equals to his Brothers and kin.
<u>Roles and Titles</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<span>Maw of Fenrir</span>The leader of the order, the Maw is the most political of the brotherhood, ensuring that his warriors do not reek too much havoc upon prospective patrons. If the Maw calls for a meeting of the order, no Brother can refuse. He handles the administration and organisation of the order and all Chieftains report to him directly. There has never been a female Maw.
<span>High Ghoði</span>The most experienced and respected of the Ghoði, they are only one of two who hold the key to the elixir stores. The Maw of Fenrir holds the other and both keys must be used to acces the draught. The High Ghoði is in charge of training the Ghoði and deciding to whom to reveal the secret elixir recipe.
<span>Ghoði</span>A priest of Fenrir, and baker of the sacred draught of the berserkers. Usually physically weaker than the Brothers but deadly in their own way, the Ghoði are also skilled at brewing poisons and medicinal tonics for the order's use.
<span>Chieftain</span>Berserkers either travel alone or in small packs. Each pack is led by a Chieftain who is responsible for their equipment, health and place of residence. They are also in charge of all deals and bargaining made for their fighters' services. It is their responsibility to keep the berserkers in their charge under control. They must also answer to the Maw and are charged with bringing a percentage of all earnings back to Tiwsborg to be placed in the order's collective treasury. Chieftains often take another percentage of the earnings for themselves before dividing what is left between his men.
<span>Brother</span>Full, initiated members of the order. They can travel in a pack under a Chieftain or alone. Whilst most in the order are males, females are accepted when they show exceptional promise. As a mantle of equality, they are also referred to as 'Brothers'.
<span>Lone</span>Brothers who decide to travel alone are referred to as "lones". They negotiate the cost of their own services and handle the duties of a Chieftain, if only for themselves.
<span>Prospect</span>Individuals who wish to become Brothers and are currently undergoing the necessary training at Tiwsborg fortress.
<u>Practices and Rituals</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>The Oathtaking</b>Joining the Order</span>
Once a prospect is declared worthy of joining the order, they must complete the Oathtaking. The most senior Ghoði or Chieftain available will accept the oath. All currently staying in Tiwsborg must attend. All in attendance then have a duty for the rest of their life to ensure that the prospect keeps their vow. The prospect's hand is cut and their new wolf head amulet placed in their bloody grasp. The newly minted Brothers are then allowed to rise, marking the last time they will kneel to anyone. All present then indulge in an epic feast with much mead, meat and sex with local men and women.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Warband Claiming</b>Joining a Warband</span>
A newly sworn Brother must remain at Tiwsborg until the next bi-monthly warband claiming. Chieftains looking to expand their ranks will return to Tiswborg every second lunar cycle. Any prospects who were initiated within the last two months are then presented to the gathering and Chieftains choose those they wish to claim. Being claimed first is a great compliment, but so is being left unclaimed completely. Only fighters whom Chieftains fear being able to control are left without a warband to join. They become fearsome lones, travelling Ostjörð under their own command. Newly minted Brothers can also, in this ceremony, choose to roam as lone fighters. This must be permitted by the Maw of Fenrir. If denied, they must allow themselves to be offered for claiming by the Chieftains like the rest. After being claimed, the Brother can leave Tiwsborg in the company of his new warband.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Blodmonath and Feast Days</b>Annual Observances</span>
The berserkers follow many of the traditional feastdays and perform the sacrifices the other people of Ostjörð do, from Yule to Blodmonath. Their celebrations are known for their violence, excess and fornication.
</div>
<u>Joining the Order</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
As lones and warbands travel the lands, they often encounter those who might serve well in the order. Or they are approached by young men and woman eager to join. It is up to the berserker whether they escort these interested parties back to Tiwsborg for training. Many skilled or permanently injured Brothers reside at Tiwsborg. Their primary duty is to train the prospects brought before them. However, if upon assessment they do not consider a prospect worthy of training they are either ousted (to the shame of the Brother who brought them) or the Brother who escorted them must remain in Tiwsborg and train them him/herself. This duty must be weighed when deciding whether to bring newcomers into the fold. Once a prospect is accepted as a Brother the person who first nominated then at Tiwsborg is no longer responsible for them. But there is a certain prestige in bringing multiple, successful prospects into the order. Equally, bringing prospects to Tiwsborg who are later deemed weak or unfit does not reflect well on the Brother who nominated them.
<span>In Roleplay</span>If you wish to create a berserker, you can create them as already accepted. We recommend checking the Current Members list above to find an existing member of the order who might have nominated or trained them in order to build plotting opportunities. However, their nominator/trainer can also be an NPC you have made up. If you wish for your character to become a berserker in-game, please contact the relevant members of the order already in play. They must agree that their character would nominate yours for a place in the order. If there are no workable nominators available, please <a href="/conversation/new/1">message the staff team</a> for help.

The City Protectors are the vigilant guardians of Jerusalem, recently formed by Simeon of Nissim to protect the city and its people from wrongdoing. They are a symbol of authority and security, committed to mercilessly upholding justice but with the intention of compassion: a safe world may be hard to cement but, once achieved, is a gift to all. They are guided in this philosophy by a deep-rooted faith in their sacred mission.
<br><br>The City Protectors are greatly entrenched with religious values: they do not consider themselves a military unit, but one made up of those volunteer citizens that love their city and wish to see it thrive. As such, they avoid violence when restraining criminals and, though they carry swords as a symbol of their authority, these weapons find themselves rarely used. Particularly as the carrying of blades is forbidden to all but the City Protector order in Jerusalem, making those they are arresting less armed than they. To draw upon them would be excessive. In-keeping with this, volunteers in the Protectors order are rarely trained as military personnel. As Phoenicia has no armed forces, the swords at the hips of a Protector are rarely tools they know how to use. Their appearance is enough of a deterent to wrong-doers.
<br><br>Public opinion on the Protectors is divisive. Whilst many adore the men willing to volunteer their time to keep the streets safe and the citizens of Jerusalem content, there are those who dislike the arrogant authority with which the order can carry out its duties. If a criminal is suspected within a dwelling, the City Protectors have absolute authority to invade the home and pull them out. It is entirely their own discretion who to arrest on the streets and many carry out their responsibilities with a high opinion of their own importance. Their originator, Simeon of Nissim, has yet to curtail or refine the boundaries of the order's powers, making them a source of disgruntlement as much as they are a beacon of hope.

<u>History</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
The City Protectors are a relatively new order established by Simeon of Nissim, who formed them to protect his city from the rising levels of crime that had begun to permeate through the streets as population numbers naturally increased.
<br><br>In recent years, prior to the order's creation, Jerusalem had been the victim of growing unrest. The city was facing an increase in petty crimes and lawlessness that brazenly challenged the city's sacred principles. With no official military within Phoenicia, miscreants grew bolder and more aggresive: pickpockets roamed the streets, merchants cheated their customers and public brawls became commonplace. Whilst wrong-doers were often caught and hauled before the Mahnheeg offices for punishment by the common people or good samaritan neighbours, this did little to stem the tide. As far as the criminals of Jerusalem were concerned, the city was a free ground for acts of defiance.
<br><br>The situation finally came to a head when a group of desperate thieves attempted to infiltrate the Holy Sanctuary itself, seeking to steal sacred relics from within its hallowed halls and smuggle them from the city. Although they were caught before any true harm could be done, the very thought of such sacrilege shook the city to its core. People were alarmed by such an act of blasphemy, and none more so than the Mahnheeg, Simeon of Nissim, who recognised a need to protect his people and maintain the sanctity of Jerusalem. Thus, the City Protectors were formed: not as an order of soldiers but one of devoted citizens dedicated to the protection of the city. A call for volunteers was put out, and many men quickly joined, eager to protect the city’s peace. Some enlisted out of recognition over the rising disorder in their community, others with concern for their families and sacred spaces, but all wanted to help. This was their home, and none would defile it.
<br><br>Armed with swords in a city where no others are permitted to carry weapons, it did not matter that City Protectors had no formal military training — indeed, many had little to no experience with weaponry at all. Those who were once quick to thieve or harm were suddenly more cautious, fearful of the groups of armed men that began to roam the city in organised patterns. People quickly grew to respect the patrols, seeing them as an authority that granted a sense of security even to those less fortunate citizens.
<br><br>Nonetheless, the newfound presence of the City Protectors has begun to spark some debate, both in Jerusalem and the other Phoenician cities with no such order to speak of. While some see them as a model to be emulated, others consider them a potential threat that could be easily corrupted or used as a force for tyranny. As such, the City Protectors operate with a strict code of ethics rooted in their religious devotion. Their swords are to be seen as symbols of authority rather than instruments of violence, and they work with a deep-rooted conviction that their duty is to protect, not to harm. Still, such conviction and faith in the importance of their work leads to an unyielding sense of entitled justice and some citizens of Jersualem feel that their new champions of safety are a little too big for their own boots and should be restrained in their quest for peace.
<u>Roles and Titles</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<span>Shofet Shamar</span>A shofet shamar is a higher-ranked member of the City Protectors. These men lead the others on their patrols around the city and take responsibiliy for their actions. Shofet shamars are typically chosen from those members who have either been in the order longer and have a solid understanding of its methods and values or those with a privileged connection to the Meier family.
<span>Shamar</span>A shamar is a regular member of the City Protectors. These men are split into groups of two to six and patrol Jerusalem, providing a sense of security for the people. Shamars are not capable of dispensing justice themselves but simply serve to dissuade and imprison criminals for the Mahnheeg's eventual judgement.
<span>Chadash Shamar</span>A chadash shamar is a new member of the City Protectors. This title is bestowed upon those new recruits that have yet to take their vow of dedication to Jerusalem and have not yet received their swords. They shadow existing patrols and are assessed on their ability to become a future member of the order. They are often referred to merely as 'chadash', similar to the term 'newbie' or 'probie'.
<u>Practices and Rituals</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>The Shevuah</b>The Official Oath</span>
This solemn vow is taken by a chadash shamar in order to become a shamar. It is a sacred pledge in which the recruit, surrounded by other recruits, shamar and shofet shamar, commits to upholding the values of the order, safeguarding the streets of Jerusalem, and protecting its citizens with humility and justice. It is not just a formality but a profound declaration of loyalty to the city and its faith: thus, those who undertake the Shevuah must do so with great sincerity. The Shevuah is usually undertaken after three patrols, at which point chadash shamar will have been evaluated by a shofet shamar who deems them worthy of joining the order. This evaluation may take longer and is at the Shofet Shamar's discretion. When enough Chadash Shamars are awaiting to take their Shevuah, a Shevuah ceremony is arranged. Only after this oath is a Chadash Shamar (now Shamar) permitted to carry a weapon.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>The Aliyat Achrayut</b>Becoming a Shofet Shamar</span>
The Aliyat Achrayut of Responsibility is a modest, yet meaningful ceremony, where the selected shamar is recognised for their dedication, leadership and deep understanding of the order's values. They are celebrated by their fellow shamar, who offer words of praise that highlight their dedication to the City Protectors, before they are given a slightly more ornate sword to mark their new role as a leader among the order. This sword usually has a more ornate handle and is tied with a rich burgundy, tassled sash. It is a sign of their authority and the trust placed in them to guide and protect their fellow shamars. After the Aliyat Achrayut, the newly appointed Shofet Shamar takes a moment of quiet reflection, reaffirming their faith and commitment to their sacred duty.
</div>
<u>Joining the Order</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
Joining the City Protectors is a straightforward process. Prospective members must be males who are both able-bodied and of age. To join, they must simply visit the order's headquarters and declare their desire to serve their city faithfully.
<span>In Roleplay</span>Members are welcome to create characters that are already a part of this order. Alternatively, if you wish to have your character join the order in game, simply go to the <a href="/board/1138">City Protectors headquarters</a> and have your character request to enlist as a Chadash Shamar.

The Creed; a shadowy faction of anarchists bent on simple, hateful revenge. While no-one has ever managed to establish their true purpose or end goals, the Creed's manner of attack and target of terrorist action is clear: they hunt, attack and publicly disgrace the upper circles of Taengean nobility as effectively as they can.
<br><br>Little else is known of the Creed. Whilst no two Creed members are ever dressed alike, all members mummify their limbs and faces in dark bandages and keep hoods and cloaks around their bodies. Identities are unimportant in the Creed; for they all act as one being. When one is captured, they would rather swallow poison than reveal the Creed's secrets. If they can extinguish themselves in a way that keeps their true name and face a mystery, all the better.
<br><br>These devout acolytes are known collectively as The Drowned. Or the Drowned Ones. Others call them Creeders. Rumour tells that they are souls lost in the River Styx, unable to move into Hades. Part of this belief is founded on the way The Drowned move; with unnatural, fluid grace and impossible speed. Flexible, strong and lethal in hand-to-hand combat, The Drowned favour projectiles and hidden blades over swords or more obvious weapons. They are entirely mute and have been known to remain so, even under torture or when in extreme pain. Due to the masks with dark gauze over even their eyes, some claim that the drowned souls are also blind to the world of mortal man; that they simply follow the path Hades whispers to them...

<u>History</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
Whilst no-one knows the true origin of the Creed, the most common theory is close enough to the truth. Almost forty years ago, the Taengean forces were at war with great empire of K'm't. After a great victory by the Hellenes naval forces led by Prince Irakles, King Zenon took the moment of glory to sue for peace. Some believe him over-generous in his decision to exchange slaves with the Pharaoh as a gesture of good will. When several of te ships Taengea sent with slaves aboard were lost in a storm, many of the traded souls to arrive in Africa had not only lost their homes but their loved ones along the way. Several of the survivors banded together, forming a secret organisation that vowed revenge upon the upper classes of Taengea, particularly the House of Mikaelidas. It is their descendants that now seem to wear the masks of the Creed. Named for the drowned souls lost in the Aegean.
<br><br>Inheritance, however, is not the only way that Creeders achieve their wrappings. Recruitment has spread across K'm't and Hellas, looking for those sympathetic to a cause against the ruling classes. Now, anyone within any sphere of society could be a secret Drowned One, hiding in plain sight and ready to don the mask whenever their Shade - their leader - commands it.
<u>Roles and Titles</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<span>The Shade</span>Known merely as The Shade, this is the leader of the Creed. Nothing else is known of them; not even by The Drowned themselves. How a Shade is selected or established is unknown.
<span>Drowned One</span>A member of the Creed. All Creeders have a normal life to live. They could be a slave, citizen or member of the noble classes. They could be a well-known face or hiding in the shadows. But when they are called via secret markings on walls and whispers in hallways, their hoods are drawn and they take on their alter ego: a drowned soul straight from Hades.
<u>Practices and Rituals</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Initiation</b>Becoming a Creeder</span>
Some form of initiation must be held for a new Creed member, but no-one knows what occurs. All anyone is certain of is that it does not leave a physical mark, as no Creeder ever caught seems to show a physical sign of his allegiance.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Appointing of The Shade</b>A New Leader Takes Command</span>
Likewise, there must be some sort of communication whenever a new Shade takes command of the Creed. Unless the same individual has been in charge all these years?
</div>
<u>Joining the Order</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
The Creed is so secretive and anonymous, that Creeders do not know the identities of their brothers and sisters in masks. Recruiters must therefore also remain anonymous. By this logic, it is assumed that anyone seen to hold a festering grudge against the ruling classes of Taengea is likely to receive an anonymous note for a meeting. If attended, they must be blindfolded and taken to commune with existing members of the Creed to see if they are sympathetic to their cause. If not, they are either released or killed, depending on which course of action is a greater threat to the group.
<span>In Roleplay</span>When writing as a member of the Creed, all posts are posted through a communal, anonymous account. If you wish your character to be a member of the Creed, please <a href="/conversation/new/1">contact the staff team</a> directly for further instruction.
