A military group like no other, the Athenian Guard is a unit of soldiers sworn to the monarch, the city and each other. These men are tasked with the protection of the city they live and serve in whether that be manning the city walls in case of an attack or simply clearing the streets of drunkards after a rowdy night. They are the ones who keep the peace and ensure that all are secure under their protective vigil, day and night. The Athenian Guards are the chief policing force in the kingdom and in addition to running the city’s fylaki, it is not uncommon to see men from its ranks patrolling the streets with their signature blue sashes to mark them as a member of this order.
<br><br>Although the protection of the capital city is their chief priority, the Athenian Guard is especially noteworthy for their dedication to the crown and whoever wears it. They will protect the monarch at any cost but they will not involve themselves in the petty disputes between the Dynasteías as to who should be wearing it. After all, they are above the messy business of politics and are under the firm belief that it will bring nothing but chaos into their ranks. That being said, noblemen are not required to forgo any titles in order to join the Guard’s ranks. They are simply expected to remain silent on any family loyalties whilst on active duty. If they cannot do so, they will be sent home in disgrace.
<br><br>Valuing a man’s talents over any other quality, the Athenian Guard only allows those of an adequate skill level into their active ranks. However, they allow any citizen of the city, noble-born or common, into its barracks and are one of the few units in Hellas willing to spend years training new recruits until they reach said level of expertise. This high standard and dedication to filling their ranks with skilled fighters is what distinguishes them from other, similar orders and encourages a level of camaraderie between the men and respect between the citizens and the Guard. In exchange, though, all those within the unit are expected to dedicate their lives to their service and retiring from the guard is rare before the grip of old age.

As duties in the Guard are far different from the standard military legion, however, most Generals recognise the Commander of the Guard's authority and expertise.

<u>History</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
The origins of the Athenian Guard can be found several hundred years ago, back before Athenia was the shining gem that it is today. Back then, the young city had grown faster than it could support and mass numbers with limited resources produced desperate and criminal acts. For years, noblemen blamed the incivility of the lower classes for the violence on the streets. Those of common birth blamed a nobility failing to care for its people. Tensions came to a head when Nicon of Anagnostou, the eldest son of a baron, was found dead in the street.
<br><br>It was clear that his passing had not been peaceful by any means. Shards of terracotta were scattered on the ground around him and left in gaping wounds. To this day, his death is an unsolved mystery. However, the true horror came after his death and before he was found. The dogs and rats had scavenged the body whilst lowlifes of the city had stripped the corpse of anything of value, including the royal blue himation that the man had been adorned with. Dirt upon the body was evidence of several of the thieves literally stepping upon the dead in their desperate, heartless need for his possessions. The sheer inhumanity of the death affected men and women at all levels of society. Whoever did this had to be brought to justice.
<br><br>The king himself offered a handsome reward for whoever found the responsible party. With the promise of gold shining in the eyes of desperate men, many flocked to the palace gates with raised voices proclaiming that they knew who had done the terrible deed, but none could provide proof so the prize went unclaimed. The common people began to feel frustrated; such attention to a nobleman's death when similar fates befell their loved ones any other day of the week was distasteful. Members of the Anagnostou family were met with protests and angry mobs demanding similar reparation for their own dead. When the last of Anagnostou's male heirs were killed in a chariot accident, spurred by a frustrated crowd, something had to be done.
<br><br>Nobles gathered with demands to their king for a military unit; one that would ensure their safety on the streets. Though hesitant to introduce more weaponry to the skirmishes in the city, the king accepted that matters could not continue as they were. He appointed the House of Antonis with the task of setting up a fresh military unit for the capital itself. Within a week, the military experts of Antonis had taken Lieutenants and promising young fighters from their own province militias and brought together nearly fifty men to serve in the capital's first policing force.
<br><br>As the sun set over the city, this new brigade was dispersed into the streets in small groups of heavily armoured men all under the orders to put a stop to any deviance they came across. There was only one rule: they were not to kill anyone, regardless of the crime committed. Drunkards were escorted to their homes, brawlers were incapacitated on the spot and any thief to be found was immediately hauled to makeshift jails throughout the city to await punishment for their crime. Initially the action was a failure; the soldiers quickly became targets for the frustration of the people. But the Antonis were harsh on their men and unyielding in their rules. Eventually, the soldiers who would not kill or maim but contained and supported those from all backgrounds began to turn public opinion. Within a month, the nobles had criticisms of the Guard for not operating in favour of the upper classes. But the common people saw the Guard as heroes.
<br><br>At the king's words, the nobles were silenced and the Guard continued in their practice of equal treatment. Commoner and noblefolk alike grew used to the relief of city streets now safe to walk at night. Of course, such progression did not eradicate crime entirely. And the Guard was soon outfitted with equipment and a recognisable uniform: a sash and cloak combination, in the same bright blue shreds of Nicon of Anagnostou's himation. The Anagnostou family might have fallen out of existence but their legacy would continue. The king eventually agreed to a special fund to support the Guard and one of the old estate houses, now fallen out of use, was converted to a city barracks for the men. This facility included places for rest and training, but also armament stores and a city prison for holding drunkards and arrested criminals.
<br><br>Currently, the Athenia Guard work on rotation, protecting the city walls, the docklands and the Inner Circle, as well as organising patrols throughout the city day and night. They also supply the Royal Palace's guards which are maintained under a specialist Captain who reports to the Commander of the Guard. These men have their own rotations and shifts that are appropriately matched to the royals they are protecting.
<u>Roles and Titles</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<span>Commander</span>Leader of the Guard and the ultimate authority. He is personally in charge of organising the security of the king and his family. Most often from a royal or noble family, but not always. They will always be an experienced militant: not an appointed politician or official. Usually they will have served in the Guard itself before being promoted to Commander.
<span>Deputy</span>Serves only for a year at a time, the Deputy Commander of the Guard is chosen at the annual Feast of Men and Kings. They serve until the next feast. It is not seen as a demotion when their term comes to an end. But there is prestige attached to being appointed Deputy, particularly if te rank is awarded for multiple years in a row.
<span>Captain</span>A captain leads a large group of soldiers and lieutenants permanently. They are responsible for these men, their tasks and their resources. Captains answer to the Deputy Commander.
<span>Lieutenant</span>Appointed to a soldier who shoes particular promise, courage and skill, the rank of lieutenant does not have a formal band of men to command but they do hold authority. If they issue an order to a soldier, it is to be followed. They will often be given men to command for particular tasks or missions. Lieutenants answer to their Captain.
<u>Practices and Rituals</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Initiation</b>Joining the Guard</span>
All men are welcomed to join the ranks of the Athenian Guard, regardless of their social rank but they must be prepared to fully commit their lives to the order. New initiates move into the city’s barracks and live the life of a common soldier, completing the laborious menial tasks required by the unit. Some born to high classes can escape this if they're already an officer in a provincial military but even then their skills are put to the test in a monthly arena-style test. All initiatives, regardless of whether they have been so for a single day or ten years, are pitted against one of two highly-skilled soldiers (one noble, one common) selected by the Commander. If they are victorious in two-on-one combat, the recruit is welcomed into the Guard.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>The Feast of Men and Kings</b>An Annual Feast</span>
In honour of the agreement made between Guard and Crown to provide mutual support for one another, an annual feast is held within the palace walls for the members of the nobility and a lucky fifty full members of the Guard (selected by random ballot). Hosted in early spring, the courtyard is transformed into three dining areas; the Guard, the nobility and one raised table reserved for the monarch and the Commander of the Guard. Paid for by the nobility, this feast serves as a way to honour the soldiers’ dedication to keeping the peace in a way unexperienced by other military units. It is a fantastic experience to be one of the fifty men selected to join the Commander during the feast and some Guards become quite competitive for the chance to be chosen and mingle with the upper-classes; trading ballot tickets and bribing friends for theirs. Whilst the soldiers of the Guard may have seen certain areas of the palace whilst guarding it, a formal meal and being treated as one of the people they normally shadow is an entirely different opportunity and a highly sought reward.
</div>
<div class="practices"><span><b>Elections</b>Assigning the Deputy-Commander</span>
It is also at the Feast of Men and Kings that the Commander of the Guard will name his deputy to serve by his side for the upcoming year. If the Commander should retire or be otherwise unfit for duty, the Deputy immediately becomes the new leader. However, simply being named Deputy is not enough to ensure that one will ascend to that position. All active and retired Captains of the order must anonymously vote on the Commander's choice for a Deputy by drawing either a Circle or a Square, representing yes and no respectively, on a small piece of parchment which is placed upon the high table with the king and Commander. As these men are casting their votes, any member of the Guard is allowed to rise from their seat and speak on behalf of the nominee. Although it is frowned upon to speak against the man being voted on, no one is prevented from doing so. After all the votes have been cast and the decision is read, if the nominated Deputy has the majority vote, he is welcomed up to the raised table to sit beside the Commander for the remainder of the evening. A Deputy is nominated every year regardless of whether the position is currently filled. More often than not, the Deputy from the previous year is nominated and able to continue serving. Serving for even a year is considered a prestigious honour, so not continuing in the role of Deputy after a year is not a loss or considered a failure: merely the way the system works.
</div>
<u>Joining the Order</u><div class="brd_line"></div>
Any trainees or initiatives that are interested in joining the Guard are required to move into the Guard's barracks, don a simplified version of the Guard's uniform and armour (but with a white sash instead of a blue one) and must perform the menial and maintenance tasks of the barracks. Every month, an Initiation Test day is held and all trainees currently living within the barracks have the choice of taking the exam. On this day, they are required to beat in one-on-one combat an existing member of the Guard. An unsuccessful participant is not rejected from the barracks but, instead, allowed to remain inside the Guard's home, continuing their menial tasks until the next testing day. They can continue to do this as many times as they like or need. There is a certain level of pride and fame in passing the Guard's Initiation Day on the first attempt. However, there is also a level of respect for a man determined to keep trying. A trainee who has failed many times might be met with ridicule and begrudging respect in equal measure. Once the initiate has passed their Testing Day, they offer their oath of loyalty to the Guard and become a fully-fledged member of the Guard, are factored into duty rotation and are permitted to live outside of the barracks. They must, however, live within the city.
<span>In Roleplay</span>If you want your character to be a member of the Guard you can create them as a member already (no permission required) or they can become a member in-game. Passing a Testing Day can be written as a normal thread of your choice. However, if there are multiple members of the Guard in play, it is worth contacting staff in case the Testing Day would work well for a site-wide event.
